## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or newer
- pnpm 10.30.1
- Docker, for the local PostgreSQL database

### Install

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Configure Environment

Copy the example files and fill in the values for your local machine:

```bash
cp client/.env.example client/.env
cp server/.env.example server/.env
cp db/.env.example db/.env
```

The default local database URL is:

```text
postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/arcado
```

### Start the Database

```bash
pnpm db:up
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:push
pnpm db:seed
```

### Run the App

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The workspace starts the shared package build and then runs the client and server through Turbo.

## Useful Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev` | Start the development workspace. |
| `pnpm build` | Build all packages. |
| `pnpm lint` | Run lint checks. |
| `pnpm test` | Run package tests. |
| `pnpm db:up` | Start local PostgreSQL. |
| `pnpm db:down` | Stop local PostgreSQL. |
| `pnpm db:studio` | Open Prisma Studio. |

## Deployment

Arcado includes a full AWS path for ECS Fargate, RDS PostgreSQL, an Application Load Balancer, Secrets Manager, and ECR images.

Start with the deployment guide:

```text
deploy/README.md
```

## Brand

Arcado is designed around the feeling of starting a room in seconds and making the first round memorable. The name keeps the arcade spirit while fitting the product more cleanly than the older repository name.
